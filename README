WinFormsRailsClientDemo is a demo application which shows how to use the
railsclient.dll assembly in a WinForms application using C#.  To run this
you should first clone and build the railsclient project from here:

C:\> git clone git@github.com:mclosson/railsclient.git

Next build the project and add a reference to the resulting output assembly
(railsclient.dll).  Finally you should be able to build and run this test
application.  It is presently set to interact with a demo web service hosted
at:

http://restfuldemo.heroku.com

However you could reconfigure it to talk to your own Rails web service.  This
demo is under development and contains known bugs.  All contributions are
welcome and will likely be accepted.  Feel free to use this code in any way
you wish to.
